</div>



<div class="main">
  <p>To someone who's never coded before, the concept of creating a website from scratch -- layout, design, and all -- can seem really intimidating. JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g. having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.Js which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. 'I could never do that.' </p>

<p><strong>If you think of the difference between each structure or document.</strong></p>

<p><strong>An HTML file</strong> contains the structure of the page itself. It is kind of like the structure of the car.</p>

<p><strong>A CSS file</strong> contains the styling of the page. It allows you to change colors,positioning and more. It is kind of like the design of the car itself.</p>

<p><strong>A JavaScript file</strong> determines the dynamic and interactive elements on the page.   It determines what happens when users click, hover or type within certain elements. This is kind of like the functionality of the car.</p>

<p> </p>

      <h2>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h2>

<p>The for loop, as in C, repeats a statement or block of statements until a condition is matched. for loops are frequently used for simple iterations in which you repeat a block of statements a certain number of times and then stop, but you can use for loops for just about any kind of loop.</p>

<mark>The for loop in Java looks roughly like this:</mark>

<div class="box">

for (initialization; test; increment) {
    statements;
}
</div>

<mark>The start of the for loop has three parts:</mark>

<p>initialization is an expression that initializes the start of the loop. If you have a loop index variable to keep track of how many times the loop has occurred, this expression might declare and initialize it-for example, int i = 0. Variables that you declare in this part of the for loop are local to the loop itself; they cease existing after the loop is finished executing.
test is the test that occurs before each pass of the loop. The test must be a boolean
expression or function that returns a boolean value-for example, i < 10. If the test is true, the loop executes. Once the test is false, the loop stops executing.
increment is any expression or function call. Commonly, the increment is used to change the value of the loop index to bring the state of the loop closer to returning false and completing. The statement part of the for loop is the statements that are executed each time the loop iterates. Just as with if, you can only include one statement, although a block will work just fine as well.</p>

<p>Remember the example in the section on arrays where I said that iterating over the contents of an array is usually done with a loop? Here's an example of a for loop that does just that</p>

<mark>-it initializes all the values of a String array to null strings:</mark>

<div class="box" >

  String strArray[] = new String[10]; \\ the array
int i; // loop index

for (i = 0; i < strArray.length; i++)
    strArray[i] = "";

</div>

<p>In this example, the variable I keeps track of the number of times the loop has occurred; it also makes a convenient index for the array itself. Here, we start the for loop with an index of I. The test for when the for loop will end is whether the current index is less than the length of the array (once the index is bigger than the array, you should stop), and the increment is simply to add 1 to the index each time. Then, for every loop you can put a null string ("") into the array at the given slot.</p>

<p>Any of the parts of the for loop can be empty statements; that is, you can simply include a  semicolon with no expression or statement, and that part of the for loop will be ignored.</p>

<p>Note that if you do use a null statement in your for loop, you may have to initialize increment any loop variables or loop indices yourself elsewhere in the program. </p>

<p>You can also have an empty statement for the body of your for loop, if everything you want to do is in the first line of that loop. For example, here's one that finds the first prime number higher than 4000 (it calls a method called notPrime(), which will theoretically have way of figuring that out):</p>
<div class="box">

for (i = 4001; notPrime(i); i += 2)
    ;
<p><strong>Note that a common mistake in C that also occurs in Java is to accidentally put a semicolon after the first line of the for loop:</strong></p>

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++);
    System.out.println("Loop!");
</div>

<p>Because the first semicolon ends the loop with an empty statement, the loop doesn't actually do anything. The println() function will be printed only once because it's actually outside the for loop entirely. Be careful not to make this mistake in your own Java programs.</p>

<p>To finish up for loops, let's rewrite that example with the names from the array section. The original example is long and repetitive and only works with an array four elements long. This version, shown in Listing 5.4, is shorter and more flexible (but it returns the same output).</p>

<h3>Functions and why they are useful</h3>

<p><strong>What is a Function?</strong>

A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.  Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.</p>

<p>Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function.
Values can be passed into functions and used within the function.
Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.
The most fundamental of the conditional statements is the if statement. An if statement will evaluate whether a statement is true or false, and only run if the statement returns true. The code block will be ignored in the case of a false result, and the program will skip to the next section.</p>

<p>An if statement is written with the if keyword, followed by a condition in parentheses, with the code to be executed in between curly brackets. In short, it can be written as if () {}.</p>

<strong>Here is a longer examination of the basic if statement.</strong>
<div class="box">

if (condition) {
    // code that will execute if condition is true
  }

</div>
<p>The contents of an if statement are indented, and the curly brackets containing the block of code to run do not end in a semicolon, just like a function block.</p>

<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>Functions are objects.Functions are function objects. In JavaScript, anything that is not a primitive type ( undefined, null,boolean, number, or string) is an object. Objects in JavaScript are extremely versatile. Because of this, we can even pass a function as a parameter into another function.

When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it is called a higher-order function. You’ve probably already used a bunch of higher order functions and don’t even know it: Array.prototype.mapand Array.prototype.filter are higher order functions (Just to name a couple). You can check out some of my previous articles to learn more about objects and higher order functions in JavaScript…</p>

<h4>The DOM and DevTools</h4>

<p>DevTools is a set of web developers tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.  Dev tools helps you edit pages on-the-fly and diagnose problems quickly, which ultimately helps you build better website, faster.</p>

<p>The document Object Model, normally addrviated to DOM, is the way through which javaScript interacts with content within a web site. One of the ways in which we access the DOM is using Developer Tools (DevTools). DevTools also assists us with testing annd debugging websites and applications.</p>

<p>HTML and CSS are two of the fundamental languages found almost everywhere on the web.  The Document Object Model provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document.</p>
