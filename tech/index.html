  <h3>The Difference Between HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>HTML is a element document the brings structure to the page a screen display,
      paper or in other media. (the Hypertext Markup Language) and the CSS (Cascading
      Style sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. Css the
      visual and aural layout, for a variety of devices. Css saves a lot of work, it
      can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. The difference between
      the html and css is simply is html is used to create the actual content of a page,
      such as written text, and css is responsive for the design or style of the website,
      including the layout special effects and background colour.</p>

                          <h5>There are three types of CSS which are given below:</h5>
                          <li>•	Inline CSS</li>
                          <li>•	Internal or embedded CSS</li>
                          <li>•	External CSS</li>

<p>Inline Css contains the css property in the body section attached with elements is known
 as inline CSS. This kind of style is specified within an HTML tag using style attributes.</p>

<p>Internal or Embedded Css: this can be used when a single HTML document must be styled
  uniquely. The Css rule set should be within the HTML file in the head section ie. The CSS
  is embedded within the HTML file.</p>

<p>External CSS external css contains separate css files which contains only style property
   with the help of a tag attributes. Property written in a separate file with .css extension
   and should be linked to the html document using link tag. This means the for each element,
   style can be set only once and that will be applied across web pages.</p>

<p>Properties of CSS: inline css has the highest priority, then comes internal/embedded
   followed by external CSS which has the least priority. Multiple style sheets can be defined
   on one page. If for an HTML tag, style are defined in multiple style sheets then the below
   order will be followed.</p>

<p>As inline has the highest priority, any styles that are defined in the internal and external
  style sheets are overridden by inline styles. Internal or Embedded stands second in the
  priority list and overrides the styles in the external style sheet. External style sheets
  have the least priority. If there are no styles defined either in inline or internal style
  sheet then external style sheet reles are applied for the HTML tags.
