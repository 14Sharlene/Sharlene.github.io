          <h2>How would you approch a Block</h2>
           <p>

                <strong>What was the PROBLEM?</strong>
                A problem is the distance between how things currently are and the way they should be. Problem solving forms the ‘bridge’ between these two elements. In order to close the gap, you need to understand the way things are (problem) and the way they ought to be (solution).We all at somestage may become blocked ,frustrated, or just out of focus

                about a problem that we can't identify. Times like this i go for a walk, and while i am out i think about the many ways or angels in which the problem could be approched.  If that has no luck then i will do something else till it comes to me, reserch more take a break and start something else.
                What's interesting about Gestalt psychology is how they view barriers to problem solving. Here are two such barriers:

                1. Are you entrenched? Look up mental set or entrenchment. This is when you're so fixated on a solution that used to work well in the past but has no bearing to your current problem. Are you so entrenched with a method or idea that you use it even when it doesn't work? As Queen Elsa sang, "Let it go!"

                2. Are you thinking of alternative uses? There is a cognitive bias called functional fixedness which could thwart any of your critical thinking techniques by having you only see an object's conventional function.

                <strong>what problem solving techniques did you use?</strong>
                Problem solving is a valuable skill that can really only be learnt, and perfected, through continual practice. A wide range of problem solving models and techniques are available to assist in evaluating and solving diverse problems of varying degrees of complexity. As a manager you, are encouraged to find the model which best works for you - one that is flexible and can be adapted to suit your own specific circumstances. Over time, your model of choice should become an automatic and integral part of your working practices.
                Writing things down is always a good way to do things, we call this Pseudocode, working threw the code slowly and methodically so perhaps you may see what went wrong.  If this is not working then chat to someone about it often the conversation is enought for you to just look at what is in text, in front of you and the anwser comes to you as you cross over the mistake.

                  <strong>how did you feel throughtout the process?</strong>
                Question everything look at the lettering .Check all symbles are in place.  I question my self because i know the anwser is logical and given time wil show itself. Interested and intreged.
              </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>what did you learn?</strong>
                Sometimes there are no quick fixes you need to sit down and go step by step to find what the problem is.  Patience and investing time wisely. </p>
            </p>
              <h2>Solve a problem in an elegant way</h2>
              <p>
                <p>
                  <strong>What was the PROBLEM?  </strong>
                In a perfect world we would look at the method of logic and say if it works on paper then there is no problem after data entry.

                  <strong>what problem solving techniques did you use?</strong>
                  Although there is a clear distinction between problem solving and decision making, the two are often confused. Problem solving differs fundamentally from decision making. A problem occurs when something is not behaving as it should, something is deviating from the norm or something goes wrong. Decision making is a case of choosing between different alternatives. Decision making is required in response to the question: "Which computer shall I buy?" Problem solving is needed in response to the statement: "My computer won't work".

                  Most problem solving methods follow a common pattern, beginning with a definition of the problem, moving on to the consideration of potential solutions, and culminating with the selection, testing and implementation of a chosen course of action. Divergent thinking techniques can be helpful in generating creative ideas, while convergent thinking can assist in structuring and evaluating potential solutions.

                  Problems can be classified into one of two categories: the ‘fix-it’ or the ‘do-it’ scenario:

                  Fix-it – solving an existing problem, (e.g. a current product range is falling short of its sales targets). An immediate short-term solution could be to increase marketing activity, for example.
                  Do-it – moving you in the right direction for what you want to achieve, (e.g. a new product range needs to be introduced to compete with market rivals). This type of problem will require longer term planning in order to achieve its objectives.

                  <strong>how did you feel throughtout the process?</strong>
                  On going resurrance that all i need is in front of me in order to get the task completed. taking one step at a time,keep to my plan making slight changes or improvements as i go along my learning. Still pressing on with the enthusiasm and enjoying the creatativity of coding.

                <p>
                  <strong>what did you learn?</strong>
                  Don't give up! there are many ways to fix a problem. I have learn so much already but its not enought yet, from basic structure to basic design,basic javascript, what makes them tick and why they exsist.

                            <li>Asking your peers for help</li><small>-check what you are working on and lisson to what you are saying see if you can fix the problem</small>
                            <li>Asking coaches for help</li><small>-as a last resort check yourself before make sure you have covered the angles in which you are a wear of</small>
                            <li>improving your process with reflection</li><small>-keep a dialog written reflections of where you are at and gives you a reflection of where you will go.</small>
