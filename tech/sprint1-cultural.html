<p>Honest  which means to be free of deceit and truthful even sincere.  Define the quality of being fair and
truthful.  The quality of being honest uprightness and fairness.  This is important to me as I am not the
kind of person that can put up with dishonesty.  I value honest and as it can be very frustrating dealing
with lies.  People that are dishonest can be very damaging to others and this is not something I have
tolerance to deal with.  How I demonstrate this is by being true to others, in turn you are being true
to yourself. This gives a sense of satisfaction that things will move forward a lot faster for honesty
is attained. </p>
<p>Empathy this is the ability to understand to share the feelings of others.  Definition the psychological
   identification with or vicarious experiencing of the feelings, thoughts, or attitudes of another.  This
   is the experience of understanding another person’s condition form their perspective.  You place yourself
   in their shoes meet an understanding but don’t take the emotions upon yourself.  I love talking to people
   and if I am able to help them I will, but I feel that it is important to not take their problem on
   emotionally at it would be counterproductive. How I demonstrate this is being a good listener and
   trying my best to get the full picture,  I had close friends which we would share our feeling and
   help each other to getting threw things by being sound boards for each other.</P>
<p>Awhina which means to be of help to someone, to be of support to someone in time of need and to
  ‘lift up’ or give strength too.  This is important to me as it is sharing of mana that takes place
  and the gratification that is gained by being of help to someone is like no other feeling.  It’s what
  I demonstrate this is to try and help everyone I meet if I have the ability to and to find out
  information that could help them or another. If I have not already attained it.</p>
<p>Respect is to have regard for a person’s feelings and wishes, to help fight for one’s rights.
  A feeling of deep admiration for someone  or something elicited by their abilities, qualities,
  or achievements.  This is important to me because I am a firm believer that you treat others as
  you would like to be treated and I like to be respected.  So I tend to treat everyone as a friend
  till they do wrong and depending on how much of a wrong depends on if I will give them a wide birth.</p>
<p>My strengths would be the ability to get it right if it’s the last thing I do and walk away.
   I practice autonomy as it has a strong respect for individuality assuring that the client has
   the right of choice recognise the right of the whanau to make its own decisions and ensure that
   self-determination occurs when it is within the member’s power to do so”.  Resilient and constant
   is my determination to move forward. </p>

<p>My weakness is chocolate, </p>
