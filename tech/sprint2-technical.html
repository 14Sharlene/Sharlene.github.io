<h1>What Are The Best Practices Associated With Using Classes Vs. Ids?</h1>

</div>

<p>If you’re thinking of building a website its likely you’ve heard the terms “HTML” and
 “CSS,” but may be wondering how they’re different. They go hand-in-hand in building a
 webpage, but each serve a very unique purpose.
 Quite simply, HTML (Hypertext Mark up Language) is used to create the actual content of
 the page, such as written text, and CSS (Cascade Styling Sheets) is responsible for the
 design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background colour.</p>

<p>In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an selector is a
name preceded  by a hash character (“#”).  The difference between an ID and a class is that
an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than
one.</p>

<p>This allows you to set a particular style for many HTML elements with the same class.  The
class selector uses the HTML class attribute, and is defined with a “.” Id is used when we
have to apply CSS property to one attribute only.</p>

<p>A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block contains one or more declaration
separated by semicolons.  Each declaration includes a CSS property name and value, separated
by a colon.</p>

<p>The ID selector uses the id attribute of the HTML element, and is defined with a ‘#’.
Class: The class selector is used to specify a style for a group of elements.  Unlike
the ID selector, the class selector is most often used on several elements.</p>

<p>The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element,
whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.  You can also apply a selector to a
specific HTML element by simply stating the HTML selector first, so p.jam { /* whatever */ }
will only be applied to paragraph elements that have the class “jam”.  The benefit of this is
that you can have the same HTML element, but present it differently depending on its class or ID.
